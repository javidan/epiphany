# vue-challenge

You are going to create a tool that we often use in our surveys; we call it a Card Rating.

You will have 8 hours to complete the challenge. It is likely that you will not finish everything, that's ok, just do as much as you can.


## Some notes

* You will work in a Vue.js project in combination with SCSS. No additional libraries are allowed.

* Show us that you can work with single file components.

* You can use the Vuex store, this is already included in the basic setup you can find below.

* Make sure to think about responsiveness. You will only receive a desktop design, it is up to you how the mobile design should look :)

* You can use one browser of your choice to create this for. Don't forget to tell us which one you picked.

* Write sufficient code comments.


## The first steps

* Download and install a basic vue setup from here: [vue-challenge.zip](https://static.glorious.agency/challenge/vue-challenge.zip)

* Inspect the design files to see what you need to create.

* Add the attached images to the project.

* You will use a GitHub repository to save and share your code, so commit properly :)

## The challenge

> Note: You don't need to stick to the order below, feel free to choose what you would like to do first.

* Step 1

  * Recreate the design in `./readme/design_1.mov`.

  * You can pick your own background, question and text colors to use in all steps.

* Step 2

  * Recreate the design in `./readme/design_2.mov`.

  * We use font-awesome for the stars, but feel free to make your own decisions here.

* Step 3

  * Make another Card Rating, this time you should be able to select multiple buttons per card (so per quote) in stead of being able to select only a single option like in Step 1 or Step 2.

  * You can use the buttons from step 1 or think of your own.

    You can find provided assets in `./src/assets/`.

  * Again, use your own creativity on how to style this.

Other

  * Be able to drag and drop the cards in the right answer.
  * Write a test.
  * Add animations.
  * ...surprise us!

Have fun and good luck! :)
